The Mango Tree

The sun beat down on the dusty ground, warming Amina's back as she walked. 
She hummed a Swahili song, her eyes scanning the landscape. In the 
distance, she saw it: a tall mango tree, its branches heavy with ripe 
fruit. 

Amina hurried towards it, her stomach rumbling. Mangoes were her favorite 
â€“ sweet, juicy, and perfect for a hot day.  She climbed up the rough bark, 
careful not to slip on the loose soil. Reaching a branch laden with 
mangoes, she plucked one, its golden skin gleaming in the sunlight. 

As Amina savored the juicy mango, she noticed a young boy, no older than 
ten, staring at her from below. He looked hungry, his eyes wide and 
hopeful. 

"Would you like some?" Amina asked, breaking off a piece of her mango and 
offering it to him.  The boy's face lit up with a smile, and he took the 
fruit gratefully. They sat together under the shade of the tree, sharing 
the mangoes and chatting about their day.

Amina learned his name was Jabari, and he lived in a nearby village with 
his family. He told her stories about his goats and the playful monkeys 
that lived in the forest.  As the sun began to set, casting long shadows 
across the land, Amina knew it was time to go. 

"Thank you for sharing your mangoes," Jabari said, waving goodbye as she 
climbed down the tree.

Amina smiled back, feeling warm and content. Sharing a simple treat with 
another person could bring so much joy, even in the simplest of moments.  
She walked home, her heart full of hope, knowing that kindness could bloom 
like a mango tree, bringing sweetness to all who shared its shade.
